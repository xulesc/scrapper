Single and multi-threaded java implementations of KDTree based
KNN. Some python scripts for fast experimentation also included.

The project was an attempt at studying the speedup that can be
achieved with simple thread based parallelization in KNN queries.
This was something i worked on during an college assignment.

In this work the 'Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data 
Set' from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was used.
